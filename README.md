Use a Wii Guitar Hero guitar controller to drive Sonic Pi via OSC messages
==========================================================================

Inspired by https://www.instructables.com/id/Keytar-Hero-Using-a-Wii-Guitar-Controller-As-a-Syn/ but wanted to use Sonic Pi as the synth not Pure Data. Used wiiGHController.py GitHub repo for this instructable (https://github.com/analogsketchbook/keytarHero) as staring point for interfacing the guitar controller i2C to a Pi

Used ideas from https://www.hackster.io/TheBubbleworks/sonic-hero-guitar-hero-and-sonic-pi-b5f3f3 and https://github.com/WayneKeenan/SonicHero for sending OSC messages to Sonic Pi.
