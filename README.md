Use a Wii Guitar Hero guitar controller to drive Sonic Pi via OSC messages

Inspired by https://www.instructables.com/id/Keytar-Hero-Using-a-Wii-Guitar-Controller-As-a-Syn/ but wanted to use Sonic Pi as the synth not Pure Data. Used wiiGHController.py: Python library for i2c communication to the controller from the GitHub repo for this instructable (https://github.com/analogsketchbook/keytarHero) as staring point for interfacing the guitar controller to a Pi

Used https://github.com/WayneKeenan/SonicHero. Got sonicpi_osc.py from there
